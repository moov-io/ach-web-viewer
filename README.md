## Contributing

Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/moov-io/ach/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started! Checkout our [issues for first time contributors](https://github.com/moov-io/ach-web-viewer/contribute) for something to help out with.

This project uses [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules) and uses Go 1.14 or higher. See [Golang's install instructions](https://golang.org/doc/install) for help setting up Go. You can download the source code and we offer [tagged and released versions](https://github.com/moov-io/ach-web-viewer/releases/latest) as well. We highly recommend you use a tagged release for production.

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is a good candidate for new contributors while also allowing the project to move more quickly by reducing regressions issues that might not be caught before a release is pushed out to our users. One great way to improve coverage is by adding edge cases and different inputs to functions (or [contributing and running fuzzers](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz)).
